# Uber-driver-demand-supply-gap-predictor-using-decision-tree-regression

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting the supply-demand gap for Uber services in City M during a specific period in the fourth and fifth weeks of 2016. The goal is to maximize driver utilization and ensure that riders can easily find available cars whenever and wherever they need them.

# Problem Understanding and Formulation
The challenge involves predicting the supply-demand gap, which represents the difference between passenger requests (demand) and driver responses (supply) within a given region and time slot. To tackle this problem, we utilize three weeks of training data to develop a predictive model. The dataset includes information about orders, regions, and points of interest (POIs) in the city, with the dataset anonymized to remove sensitive data.

# Data Understanding and Preparation
To prepare the data for analysis, we followed several steps:

Conversion of Files: We converted the provided files into the widely used CSV format to facilitate easy data manipulation and analysis.

Replacing Region Hashes: In the orders data, we replaced the region hashes with the corresponding region IDs from the cluster_map file. This substitution allows for easy mapping between regions and their respective IDs.

Splitting Timestamps: We split the timestamp column into separate date and time columns to enable analysis based on date and time.

Converting Time to Time Slots: The time was converted into time slots using the datetime library in Python. This step facilitates grouping of orders based on time slots.

Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Certain columns, such as Order ID, Passenger ID, Destination Region ID, and Price, were dropped as they were not relevant for the analysis.

Extracting Weather and Temperature Information: We extracted weather and temperature data for each date and timestamp to investigate potential correlations between weather conditions and order volume.

Cleaning POI File: The POI file was cleaned to extract relevant features for each location, such as POI category.

These steps ensured that the data was in a clean and organized format suitable for further analysis.

# Feature Engineering
The final dataset includes the following features:

Start Region ID: The ID of the starting region for each ride.
Date: The date when the ride took place.
Time Slot: The time slot during which the ride occurred.
Gap: The target variable representing the time gap between the ride request and the actual pickup.
Day: The day of the week when the ride took place.
Temperature: The temperature at the time of the ride.
Weather: The weather conditions at the time of the ride.
POI Features: Features representing the point of interest (POI) attributes of the starting region.
These features were obtained through feature engineering, including direct extraction from the data, cleaning and processing of the POI file, and combining the relevant features into a single CSV file. This prepared dataset serves as the basis for model training and prediction.

# Model Selection and Evaluation
Several machine learning algorithms were considered for predicting the supply-demand gap, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression. The models were trained on the provided training data and evaluated using mean squared error (MSE), R-squared, and accuracy metrics.

The Decision Tree Regression model yielded the best performance with an MSE of 52.4113 and an R-squared value of 0.9807. This model effectively captures the trends and patterns in the data and provides accurate predictions of the supply-demand gap.

# Model Optimization
The Decision Tree Regression model can be further optimized through various techniques:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search or random search can be employed to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that maximize the model's performance.
Pruning: Techniques such as cost complexity pruning can be used to simplify the decision tree and improve its generalization to unseen data.
Feature Selection: Identifying and removing irrelevant or redundant features can enhance the model's performance and mitigate overfitting.
Ensemble Methods: Combining the decision tree with other models, such as random forests or gradient boosting, can potentially improve the overall predictive power of the model.
Applying these optimization techniques can lead to further improvements in the model's performance.

# Model Testing and Evaluation
For evaluation purposes, we used common metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics allow us to assess the performance of the model and determine how well it captures the variation in the target variable.

The results of the evaluation are presented in the notebook. Please refer to the notebook for a detailed analysis of the model's performance and the corresponding evaluation metrics.

# Conclusion
This project aimed to predict the supply-demand gap for Uber services in City M during a specific period. By leveraging machine learning techniques and data analysis, we successfully developed a Decision Tree Regression model that accurately predicts the supply-demand gap. The feature engineering process, model evaluation, and optimization steps provided valuable insights into the factors influencing the gap and offered potential strategies for maximizing driver utilization.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the problem, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and optimization.
